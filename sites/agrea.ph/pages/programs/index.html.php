			<p>To achieve One-Island Economy in the Province of Marinduque, AGREA implements community-based and organization-based programs supported by training and workshops for individuals that address Zero Waste, Zero Hunger, and Zero Insufficiency.</p>

			<p>In order to achieve the One-Island Economy Model, AGREA dissects its programs into three impact areas. The said impact areas aim to thread together economic development, social well-being, and environmental sensitivity. </p>

			<p>THREE ZEROS. One Island Economy is economic development with sensitivity to the environment and concern for social well-being. </p>

			<p>Our focus is on farmers and fishermen in Marinduque. AGREA believes that their role is as important as any other stakeholder in the goods value chain. AGREA believes that through technology, education and community empowerment, farmers can have a fairer business share, more autonomy, more dignity and a better quality of life.</p>

		<p>But our farmers and fisher folks are endangered species. Today's challenges in Philippine agriculture include land, climate, and support system for food production.</p>
